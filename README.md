# ece_ntua_website

This demo website contains a simple homepage and a course catalog inspired by the University of Groningen's Ocasys layout. The catalog page can be found at `catalog.html`.
Students can experiment with different specialization flows using `specialization.html`,
which now lists obligatory courses with semesters and lets you export your choices
to a PDF including the NTUA logo and the current date.
